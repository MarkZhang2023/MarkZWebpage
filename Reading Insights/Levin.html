                        <h2>The Incomprehensible Distance Between People</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">The distance between people is an intriguing topic in "Anna Karenina." Nikolai spends his days idly engaging in political discussions, a contrast to Levin's lack of interest in politics. Levin's other brother, Koznyshev, is highly intellectual, while Levin, a simple farmer, struggled with calculus during his university days and always found it challenging to keep up with Koznyshev's conversations. Despite having little in common with Nikolai and Koznyshev, Levin gets along well with both because he is an emotional man who values family bonds. He frequently visits his two brothers, especially after a significant time apart. The first recorded visit of Levin to Nikolai is described as a peaceful encounter.<br> <br>In the later part of the book, Nikolai, aware of his impending death, decides to spend his final days on Levin's farm, which initially goes well. However, their relationship soon takes a turn for the worse due to minor conflicts. Eventually, Nikolai decides to leave Levin's farm, using their recent argument as an excuse. Levin is left puzzled as to why a seemingly joyful reunion turned into an awkward situation. He found that human relationships are complex; distancing can lead to longing, while excessive closeness can breed discomfort.<br> <br>Levin is correct. Upon learning of Nikolai's severe illness, Levin rushes to the hospital with Kitty to care for his ailing brother. Initially sympathetic and considerate, Levin takes care of Nikolai and listens to his words. However, as the days pass, the burden of handling bodily functions and enduring Nikolai's suffering causes Levin to become impatient, even though he knows it's wrong. He leaves the nursing responsibilities to the kind-hearted Kitty. Gradually, even Kitty finds it difficult to tolerate the dying patient. At this point, everyone wishes for Nikolai's life to end quickly, as it would bring relief to both Nikolai and those around him.<br> <br>There is no doubt that the bond between Nikolai and Levin, as brothers, is deeply cherished by both. Otherwise, Nikolai, who appeared tough on the outside but had a softer side, wouldn't have left Levin's farm out of fear for causing Levin grief during his final moments. Levin also wouldn't have gone to great lengths to care for Nikolai as he approached death. The distance between people is indeed challenging to navigate, likely due to the difficulty in achieving complete mutual understanding.</p>
